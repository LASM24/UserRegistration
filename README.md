This "README" is to communicate the best way to use this mini project. The 4 recommendations are the following:

1). In the carpet called "SQL" there is the code necessary to create the database and be able to connect it with the HTML and PHP files. I recommend using the same name as the code discussion left to avoid connection problems.

2) . create the DB in PhpMyAdmin as it is the easiest way to create and monitor the logs

3). Run the project on the Apache server proposed by XAMPP, because when opening it in the browser and wanting to save the logs, the log file causes problems. (I'll work on that soon)
